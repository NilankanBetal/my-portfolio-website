    This is the html file of my portfolio website. The whole structure of the website will be coded here.

    
    
    Description:

    At the head tag, we can see that this file is linked with two more files currently,
    one is the css file of this page and another is the javascript file, also for this page.

    We can also see a meta tag at the below the head tag.

    The name of the css file is "index-layout.css".
    The name of the javascript file is "index-jsfile.js".

    A icon is also attached with the page.
    The name of the icon is "MyPic-png-for-icon.png".
    It is the same picture, which is inside the website.

    Later on, we can see that the page is linked with other files.

    At the body tag, it's declared that the website will be run only on english language.
    Then the welcome sentence comes, with some text effect, mentioned in the linked CSS file of this website.
    Then my image is to be visible with round shape.
    Afterthat, a "I'm Nilankan" this text can be seen with a gradiant effect.
    Then the two button come, first is on about me and the next is for my contact details.

    #Every effect can be seen on this are mentioned in the CSS file of this website, linked in the head tag.
    ***To Be Continued...***
